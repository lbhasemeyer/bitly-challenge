## Something to know:
* The animal details page background color changes based on if the animal is nocturnal or diurnal.

## If I had more time I would...
* Write more tests (I did write some for App.tsx and Home/index.tsx)
* Learn more about Typescript - this was my first experience with it
* Make the UI prettier
* Have better git flow - write new code on branches, and merge those to master
* Add a redux flow (if handling more data / pages / calls)
* Break props into a constants file
